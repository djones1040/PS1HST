Pan-STARRS/HST Supernova Project!
=================================

For a few notes on getting started at the command line and with
Anaconda python, see here:

I haven't written anything up for SAOImage DS9 yet, but grab that
from here: <http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html> and try to explore 
how to view FITS images with this software.

I'm going to add a few more general instructions as we go along.
